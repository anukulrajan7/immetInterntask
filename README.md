# Project Setup and Configuration

This document provides a brief overview of the project setup and configuration for a React application. The file structure is organized as follows:

- `src/components`: Contains reusable components used throughout the application.
- `src/pages`: Holds the individual page components.
- `src/firebase`: Contains Firebase-related files, including the configuration file.
- `src/routes`: Contains files related to routing and navigation.
- `src/redux`: Holds Redux-related files for managing global state.
- `src/context`: Contains context files for managing app-level state using the Context API.
- `src/App.js`: The root component of the application where routing and the main layout are set up.
- `src/index.js`: The entry point of the application where the main `App` component is rendered.

The project utilizes various libraries and tools, including Tailwind CSS, Material UI, React Toast, React DOM, and Firebase. To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server using the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will launch the React application and provide a local development environment.

Note: The `node_modules` directory is typically included in the `.gitignore` file to exclude it from version control.
